# Project 1 – Capstone: Technology Trends & Developer Demographics

This project analyzes current and future technology trends alongside developer demographics using global survey data. It combines IBM Cognos dashboards with Python-based data cleaning and visualizations.

## Project Highlights

- **Languages**: JavaScript, SQL, and Python are consistently popular; Go and Rust are rising.
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL dominates, while Redis and Supabase are gaining traction.
- **Frameworks**: Node.js and React lead current usage; FastAPI and Vercel are gaining momentum.
- **AI Tools**: Younger developers (25–34) use AI heavily for debugging, coding, and research.
- **Job Market vs. Pay**: Legacy tools dominate job postings, but niche languages command higher salaries.

## Tools & Skills

- IBM Cognos (dashboards)
- Python (pandas, collections, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
