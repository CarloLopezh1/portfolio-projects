# Predicting Premier League Wins Using FIFA Player Ratings ‚öΩÔ∏èüìà

This project explores how well FIFA video game player ratings can predict match outcomes in the English Premier League. By merging player-level FIFA data with Premier League match statistics, we created and tested predictive models with real-world implications ‚Äî particularly in the context of sports betting.

## Project Overview

**Goal:**  
Evaluate whether differences in FIFA player ratings between opposing teams can predict match outcomes (win vs. not win) for the home team in Premier League matches.

**Why It Matters:**  
If FIFA ratings ‚Äî though fictional ‚Äî can serve as a reliable proxy for real-world performance, they could support more informed sports betting, preseason predictions, and fan-driven analysis.

## What We Did

- **Data Merging & Wrangling:** Combined FIFA 20 player data (2015‚Äì2020) with Premier League match outcomes (2010‚Äì2021).
- **Feature Engineering:** Created position-group aggregates (Attack, Midfield, Defense, Goalkeeper) and calculated rating differentials (home vs. away).
- **Modeling:** Built and evaluated 3 logistic regression models to predict whether the home team wins.
- **Evaluation:** Compared models using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and PPV ‚Äî key metrics for betting decisions.

## Key Results

- **Final model accuracy:** 71.31% at 0.6 cutoff  
-  **Most predictive features:**  
  - Difference in maximum attack ratings  
  - Difference in median midfield ratings  
  - Goalkeeper rating differences  
-  **Least important feature:** Work rate (except for goalkeeper)
